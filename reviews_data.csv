2,4,It is perfect. But you need to add Spider-Man. I know that it would cost a truck load of money but it will be worth it.
2,5,"Can watch all of the new Disney stuff, plus, Walt even allows you to get into his Vault and watch some of his Original Golden Oldies. It also gives us the opportunity to watch Marvel Studios, Pixar, Hulu, plus others at ONE Fantastic Annual Price! I have ALWAYS LOVED DISNEY! These other channels are an added bonus!"
2,4,PLEASE ADD SPIDER MAN!!!!
2,5,All your favorite Disney movies and shows in one place . Even recent movies
2,4,It keeps lagging and I'am getting bored with Bluey. Please make new episodes that are funny.
2,4,My kids love this streaming app and so do I.
2,4,"Toooons of content, but maybe too much. Disney is saturating the airwaves with a lot of fluff. It’s not user-friendly to find older movies and cartoons from before 1990."
2,3,Disney is not what it used to be
2,3,Picture quality is fabulous but the only problem I have constantly is being able to just click on Disney and the app Open.
2,5,I love it so much!!!!
1,1,If I could give zero stars I would. Like mostly everything Netflix has become unaffordable. With the new guidelines all my favourite things about the service are gone. They are becoming one step closer to becoming like the cable companies I so despise.
1,1,"Shows after shows cancelled and taken off, now they expect us to stay in the same address. Thank you Netflix for bringing back old technology. Nothing better than experiencing the drawbacks of cable TV on your phone."
1,5,It is the first service with perfect suggestions for me!
1,5,Netflix is my go-to streaming network. The site is super user friendly. It will send me updates and new releases of either shows I've been watching or show it thinks I'd enjoy based off my history.
1,5,Nothing could be better than chillin' out and watching your favourite series... I'm just loving all the series and this beautiful platform as well!
1,1,Netflix have really good shows but the big issue is Netflix do not continue the seasons. They have the customers waiting for season 2 and it never comes. I have watched so many international movie shows that have season 2 and Netflix did not fulfill this.
1,4,"Netflix is a good source of entertainment when you are ready to settle down for the night with nothing else to do. I have to admit I spend about 20 sometimes 30 minutes scrolling through the titles looking for something before I settle on the movie, and then sometimes end up dumping it. I wish there was a way for it to be more organized."
1,5,They have very large list of movies and series all of them better than other. I enjoy binge watching series on weekend. High quality content.
3,5,"I find what I am looking for easily. When I'm not sure just what I want to watch the suggestions are right there too. App is easy to use, and the video is high quality."
3,4,Worked as expected.
3,4,Getting better and better
3,5,Relax and enjoy a movie plus I enjoy the older show
3,1,"Movies = 99% junk, any decent,good,great movie you want to watch you will have to pay extra to watch."
3,3,it is unreliable
3,5,It's a GREAT App. Easy to use
4,3,"I hate that we pay for this service and still have to sit through ads… I wish that the shows and movies stayed longer before rotating off, but otherwise I like Hulu. not as good as the others."
4,4,Hulu plus is worth the extra cost. Hulu plus is cheaper than cable and with more freedom.
4,4,Hulu plus does have certain shows worth watching. But variety is limited. The jfk series was great but they could have extended the series.
4,3,Hulu kinda disappoints me. Seems like they have one really good show at a time and otherwise their options aren't that good. Pretty annoying having to pay extra to not have ads too.
4,5,I had them and they were great very good selection of movies and at a very good price would reccomend them
